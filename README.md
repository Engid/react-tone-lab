# Motivation

Howdy. I'm working on my site [RatioTune](https://ratiotune.com) and I feel like it would be nice to have a repository
to demo simple React interfaces for [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) without having to publish the entire source for RatioTune. 

I'm attempting to only use React without any other dependencies. I'll probably add things as time goes on, but for now
I'm simply hoping to re-write a few of the examples from the Tone.js site. 

# Project Status

This is super alpha right now. I'm just testing things by hand from the dev server, so don't expect this to be 
a place to copy/paste production-ready stuff from. I'm just trying to use it as a place to test out ideas.

# Usage

Since this is created using create-react-app, the usual scripts work. If you want to play around with it from `localhost:3000`, simply fire up
the command line and run:
```
> npm start
```
